<hr/>
INNER JOIN:  Select only those rows that have values in common in the columns specified in the ON clause.

<br/> 

LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL OUTER JOIN:  Select all rows from the table on the left (or right, or both) regardless of whether the other table has values in common and (usually) enter NULL where data is missing.   
<br/> 
CROSS JOIN :  Select all possible combinations of  rows and columns from both tables (Cartesian product).
