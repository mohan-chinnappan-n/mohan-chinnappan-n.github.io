"App":" An app contains dashboards, lenses, and datasets in any combination that makes sense for sharing your data analyses with colleagues. Apps are like folders. They allow users to organize their data projects—private and shared—and to control sharing."
,"Dashboard":" A dashboard is a curated set of charts, metrics, and tables based on the data in one or more lenses."
,"Dashboard JSON file":" A dashboard JSON file defines the components that a dashboard contains and describes how they’re connected."
,"Data monitor":" The data monitor tool allows you to monitor dataflow and system jobs. You can also use it to start, stop, reschedule, download, and upload dataflows."
,"Dataflow":" A dataflow is a set of instructions that specifies what data to extract from Salesforce objects or datasets, how to transform the datasets, and which datasets to make available for querying."
,"Dataflow definition file":" A dataflow definition file is a JSON file that contains transformations that represent the dataflow logic."
,"Dataflow job":" A dataflow job processes the logic in a dataflow."
,"Dataset":" A dataset contains a set of source data, specially formatted and optimized for interactive exploration."
,"Dataset builder":" The dataset builder is a point-and-click user interface that allows you to easily select and extract data from related Salesforce objects to create a single dataset."
,"Date":" A date can be represented as a day, month, year, and, optionally, time. You can group, filter, and perform math on dates."
,"Designer":" Designer is the interface where you create dashboards. There are two versions: dashboard designer (the new one) and classic designer (the legacy one)."
,"Dimension":" A dimension is a qualitative value, like region, product name, and model number. Dimensions are handy for grouping and filtering your data. Unlike measures, you can’t perform math on dimensions."
,"Explorer":" Explorer is the interface where you explore datasets and lenses."
,"Extended metadata (XMD)":" Extended metadata (XMD) allows you to customize the formatting of many dashboard elements in Analytics."
,"External data":" External data is data that resides outside of Salesforce, such as data from outside applications and spreadsheets."
,"External Data API":" Use External Data API to upload external data files to Analytics to create datasets."
,"Lens":" A lens is a particular view into a dataset’s data. It’s where you do exploratory analysis and visualization."
,"Measure":" A measure is a quantitative value, like revenue and exchange rate. You can do math on measures, such as calculating the total revenue and minimum exchange rate."
,"Metadata file":" A metadata file is a JSON file that describes the structure of an external data file."
,"Predicate":" A predicate is a filter condition that defines row-level access to records in a dataset."
,"Salesforce Analytics Query Language (SAQL)":" Use SAQL to access and analyze data in Analytics datasets."
,"Step":" A step determines the results shown in a widget. Steps either get data dynamically or statically. For example, a step can query a dataset to get the average opportunity amount for each account, or it can retrieve an unchanging, user-defined value."
,"Transformation":" A transformation refers to the manipulation of data. You can add transformations to a dataflow to extract data from Salesforce objects or datasets, transform datasets that contain Salesforce or external data, and register datasets."
,"Unit symbol (for measures)":" A unit symbol represents the unit of a shortened number that appears in a chart or number widget. Analytics uses the following symbols."
,"Thousand":" (10^3)	4K = 4,000"
,"Million":" (10^6)	4M = 4,000,000"
,"Billion":" (10^9)	4B = 4,000,000,000"
,"Trillion":" (10^12)	4T = 4,000,000,0000,000"
,"Quadrillion":" (10^15)	4P = 4,000,000,0000,000,000"
,"Quintillion":" (10^18)	4X= 4,000,000,0000,000,000,000"
,"Sextillion":" (10^21)	4Z = 4,000,000,0000,000,000,000,000"
,"Septillion":" (10^24)	4Y = 4,000,000,0000,000,000,000,000,000"
,"Thousandth":" (10^-3)	4m = 0.004"
,"Millionth":" (10^-6)	4μ = 0.000004"
,"Billionth":" (10^-9)	4n = 0.000000004"
,"Trillionth":" (10^-12)	4p = 0.000000000004"
,"Quadrillionth":" (10^-15)	4f = 0.000000000000004"
,"Quintillionth":" (10^-18)	4a = 0.000000000000000004"
,"Sextillionth":" (10^-21)	4z = 0.000000000000000000004"
,"Septillionth":" (10^-24)	4y = 0.000000000000000000000004"
,"Visualization":" A visualization is commonly a chart or graph, such as a bar chart, donut chart, timeline, or heat map. It can also be data in tabular form, such as a comparison table or pivot table. Every visualization has an underlying query, which is how Analytics retrieves information from the source data."
