Frequently, in-memory databases are volatile, meaning that they have little or no durability if the computer malfunctions. Durability issues are frequently prioritized below performance, which increases substantially with memory as the storage media."
,"DB:In-process":"When referring to a DBMS, it is in-process when the DBMS code resides in the process space of the application program that is using it. If the process is single threaded, then this is a single-user usage of the database(s). A process may have multiple threads with individual connections to a shared database, making it a multi-user database. In-process uses Local Procedure Calls (LPC) vs Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to a database server in a separate process."
,"DB:Inner Join":"A join between two tables where only the rows with matching foreign and primary key values are returned."
,"DB:Internet of Things":"A recently coined phrase describing the extended reach of connected devices. In particular, devices that use computing power to control or sense their environment and use wifi or wires to connect to the internet."

,"DB:Real-time":"A real-time environment is one in which specific tasks must be guaranteed to execute within a specified time interval. For a DBMS to be considered truly real-time, it must be able to perform specific database-related tasks in a time that can be deterministically demonstrated—i.e., the worst case execution time can be demonstrated. Because a general-purpose DBMS deals with dynamic data in which the sizes of tables vary over time, and since DBMS response times depend on the amount of data to be processed they cannot be considered real-time. This is true also for RDM. It is real-time friendly, because it is fast, has a small footprint and has features (such as virtual tables and in-memory storage) that allow it to be used in beneficial ways in a real-time application."

Referential integrity is maintained by SQL during the processing of an INSERT and DELETE statement and any UPDATE statement that modifies a foreign or primary key value."
,"DB:Relational Model":"A database in which inter-table relationships are organized primarily through common data columns, which define a one-to-many relationship between a row of the primary key table and one or more rows of the matching foreign key table. Equi-joins relate tables that have matching primary/foreign key values, but other comparisons (relationships) may be defined. In addition to describing how the database tables are related, the relational model also defines how the related data can be accessed and manipulated. SQL is the most commonly used relational model database language.  "
,"DB:Remote Procedure Call":"A method of interprocess communication where a function residing within another process is called as though it is a local (in-process) function. The method is implemented through a local proxy function and a remote stub function. Parameter values are marshalled into a block of data that can be transmitted from the proxy to the stub for demarshalling and calling the actual function. Return values are processed in the same way as input values."
,"DB:Replication":"A process where selected modifications in a master database is replicated (re-played) into another database."
,"DB:Restriction Factor":"Each relational expression specified in the WHERE clause of a query has an associated restriction factor that is estimated by the SQL optimizer, which specifies the fraction (or percentage) of the table for which the expression will be true. For example, in the query select * from book where bookid = 'austen013px' the relational expression bookid = 'austen013px' has a restriction factor equal to .003 (only one out of 3213px rows will satisfy this expression)."
,"DB:Result Set":"The complete set of rows that is returned by a particular SELECT statement."

Graphical representations typically involve the use of boxes that represent database tables and arrows that represent inter-table relationships. Textual schema representations utilize Database Definition Language (DDL) statements to describe a database design."

,"DB:Seat":"A copy of a Product, or any of its components, installed on a single machine."

,"DB:Set":"A method used to implement the one-to-many relationship formed between two tables based on their foreign and primary key declarations. The term set comes from the CODASYL Network Model definition.

The etymology of SQL is unclear, possibly a progression from QueL (Query Language) to SeQueL to SQL. However, some experts don't like the expansion Structured Query Language because its structure is inconsistent and a historical patchwork.  "
,"DB:SQL PL":"A SQL based programming language.  This allows for a SQL programmer to use programming constructs like variables, conditionals and loops purely through the use of SQL statements."
,"DB:Stored Procedure":"A named and optionally parameterized compiled set of SQL database access statements that can be executed as a unit through a call to the stored procedure."

The state of the database both before and after a transaction will be consistent with its design."
,"DB:Transactional File Server (TFS)":"An architectural piece of Raima's RDM system that may be linked in-process with application code or executed separately as a server process.
