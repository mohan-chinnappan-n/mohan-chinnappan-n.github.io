"HouseWiring:Amp":" Abbreviation for ampere, the measure of the rate of flow of electric current. "
,"HouseWiring:Arc-fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI)":" A breaker that shuts off current in a circuit instantly when an arc fault is detected. Code-required for bedroom circuits starting in 2002. "
,"HouseWiring:Armored Cable":" This cable contains two insulated conductors and a thin aluminum or copper bonding strip inside a metal sheath. The metal sheath is the ground, not the bonding strip. Also called Armor-clad, AC, or BX. "
,"HouseWiring:Ballast":" The device that provides the current for fluorescent lights. Ballasts have become quite small, allowing the creation of compact fluorescent bulbs that can be used in place of incandescent bulbs. "
,"HouseWiring:Box":" Device for mounting electrical fixtures and their wiring in walls and ceilings. Common varieties include new work, old cork, single gang, two-gang, fan, and junction. "
,"HouseWiring:Branch Circuit ":"The portion of an electrical running between the breaker or fuse and the devices it powers. Can serve a single device or several. "
,"HouseWiring:Bus":" The heavy-duty, rigid connector that connects the circuit breakers or fuses to the incoming power. Also called a Busbar. "
,"HouseWiring:BX":" A brand name of armored cable. "
,"HouseWiring:Cable":" Typically, a group of individual conductors bundled together. "
,"HouseWiring:Circuit":" Branch circuit. "
,"HouseWiring:Circuit Breaker":" The overcurrent protection device (OCPD) most commonly in residential use. The circuit breaker can be opened and closed repeatedly to allow or stop power from flowing along the branch circuit. "
,"HouseWiring:Conductor":" A device intended to carry electric current, typically wire or a busbar. May also refer to anything that carries current, intended or not. "
,"HouseWiring:Current":" The rate of flow of electricity. "
,"HouseWiring:Daisy Chain":" When conductors run from one device to the next. Saves wire, but if one device fails, all downstream devices are affected. "
,"HouseWiring:Device":" The items installed in boxes that help control and distribute current, such as switches, receptacles, timers, thermostats, and dimmers. "
,"HouseWiring:Feeder":" The conductors that feed panels other than the service panel. "
,"HouseWiring:Fish Tape":" A coiled spring-steel line used for pulling, or fishing, cable and wire through enclosed spaces. "
,"HouseWiring:Fitting":" Accessories such as bushings and clamps that serve a mechanical rather than an electrical function"
,"HouseWiring:Four-way Switch ":"A set of three switches wired to control the same fixture or group of fixtures. "
,"HouseWiring:Fuse":" An overcurrent protection device that contains a thin strip of metal that will melt and open the circuit in case of circuit overload. Must be replaced after a circuit overload. "
,"HouseWiring:Gauge":"The measure of the size of a wire. The smaller the number, the thicker the wire and the higher its current-carrying capacity. "
,"HouseWiring:Goof Plate ":"An oversize cover plate designed to hide a rough patching job around a box. Note that drywall and plaster must be repaired to within 1/8 of any box; larger gaps may not simply be hidden behind a goof plate. "
,"HouseWiring:Ground":" A connector that runs between a device or circuit to safely conduct current to earth. "
,"HouseWiring:Ground Fault":" The leaking of current to the grounding conductor. "
,"HouseWiring:Ground-fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI)":" A device designed to interrupt the flow of power when a minuscule imbalance is detected between the flow and return of current. "
,"HouseWiring:Home Run":" In communications and structured wiring, when conductors are run from each device back to the source. "
,"HouseWiring:Hot":" Current is present. A hot lead is the one carrying current along a circuit. It usually has black or red insulation. A hot circuit is one in which the breaker is closed and current is present. "
,"HouseWiring:Insulation":" A material that is a poor conductor of current and therefore used to shield wires, cables, and connectors. "
,"HouseWiring:Junction Box":" A box containing splices in cables. Has a removable cover that must be accessible (cannot be buried in ceilings and walls). Also called a J-box. "
,"HouseWiring:Knob and Tube":" A system of wiring in which individual, loom-covered hot and neutral conductors were run using porcelain knobs to support the wires along framing members and porcelain tubes to protect wires passing through framing members. "
,"HouseWiring:Knockout (K.O.) ":"A partially prepunched opening in a box that is removed to allow the entry of cable. A knockout that is mistakenly opened or is open because a cable is removed must be filled with a knockout seal. "
,"HouseWiring:Live":"Hot. "
,"HouseWiring:Lug":" Used to terminate a wire. "
,"HouseWiring:NEC":" National Electrical Code® "
,"HouseWiring:Neutral":" Commonly, the return conductor in a circuit. It usually has white insulation. More properly called the grounded conductor because it returns current to ground at the service panel. Note that this is different from the green-sheathed or bare copper grounding conductor that does not carry current except in case of equipment fault. "
,"HouseWiring:Ohm":" The measure of electrical resistance. "
,"HouseWiring:Open Circuit ":"A circuit in which the flow of current is interrupted due to an open breaker or fuse. May be intentional or unintentional (as caused by a short). "
,"HouseWiring:Outlet":" Receptacle. "
,"HouseWiring:Overload ":"To run equipment or wire in excess of its normal full-load rating. "
,"HouseWiring:Pigtail ":"A short length of wire attached to an existing wire or wires. "
,"HouseWiring:Polarized":" A system in which the slots/blades for the hot leads are narrower than those for the neutral leads. "
,"HouseWiring:Raceway ":"A plastic or metal channel used to conduct wires or cables from one point to another. "
,"HouseWiring:Romex®":" A brand of nonmetallic-sheathed cable. "
,"HouseWiring:Service Entrance":"The point where the electrical service enters the house, becoming your responsibility instead of the electric company's. "
,"HouseWiring:Service Panel":"Usually installed near the service entrance, this panel contains the main switch or breaker to disconnect the house system from the power source as well as circuit breakers. "
,"HouseWiring:Short Circuit":"An accidental connection between two conductors or between a conductor and ground or some other unintended surface. "
,"HouseWiring:Single-pole Switch ":"A standard light switch with off and on positions for controlling flow of current to one or more devices. "
,"HouseWiring:Split Receptacle":"A receptacle in which each of the two outlets is wired on a different circuit or in which one outlet is always live and the other is switched. Also called split-wired. "
,"HouseWiring:Three-way Switch ":"A pair of switches wired to control the same fixture or group of fixtures. "
,"HouseWiring:UL":" Underwriters' Laboratories is a nonprofit organization that tests electrical devices to assure their compliance with the NEC. "
,"HouseWiring:Volt":" The measure of electrical pressure. "
,"HouseWiring:Watt":" The basic measure of electricity. Amps x volts = watts. "
,"HouseWiring:Wire Nut®":" A brand of twist-on wire connector. "
