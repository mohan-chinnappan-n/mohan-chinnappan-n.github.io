,"Music:Major seventh":"The interval between the root note and the seventh note (or 'degree') of a major scale. Equivalent to 11 semitones."
,"Music:Major sixth":"An interval of nine semitones between two different notes. C to A, for example."
,"Music:Major third":"An interval of four semitones between two different notes. Examples include C to E, G to B, D# to F."
,"Music:Melodic interval":"When two notes of different pitches are played one after the other - in other words, atwo-note melody."
,"Music:Melody":"A sequence of notes played one after the other to produce a tune."
,"Music:Minor scale":"The sad-sounding sequence of notes you get when you play a major scale from the sixth note upwards."
,"Music:Minor second":"An interval of one semitone between two notes. For example, C to Db is a minor second interval."
,"Music:Minor third":"An interval of three semitones between two different notes. For example, C to Eb is a minor third interval, as is G to Bb."
,"Music:Minor seventh":"The interval between the root note and the flattened seventh note (or 'degree') of a major scale. Equivalent to ten semitones."
,"Music:Minor sixth":"An interval of eight semitones between two different notes. For example, C to Ab is a minor sixth interval."
,"Music:Mode":"A type of scale built by starting another scale from a note other than its root."
,"Music:Octave":"An interval of 12 semitones, at which the two notes have the same 'quality', just one higher and one lower"
,"Music:Root":"The lowest note of a chord or scale. C is the root note of a C major chord and of the C major scale."
,"Music:Rootless voicing":"When an extended chord is played with the root note missing. Used a lot in jazz and gospel music."

,"Music:Tone":"Short for 'whole tone', an interval of two semitones."
,"Music:Tonic":"The first note, or 'root' note, of a scale."
,"Music:Transpose":"To shift a piece of music, note or chord up or down in pitch by a certain number of semitones."
,"Music:Triad":"A chord made up of three notes. A major triad contains a root, a major third and a perfect fifth."
,"Music:Unison":"An interval that's not an interval - in other words, the interval of zero semitones, the same note played twice."
