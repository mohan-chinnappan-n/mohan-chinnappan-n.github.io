## BigID 

Advanced privacy automation technology


### Area

Global data protection market  (estimate: $14.1B by 2025)

###  Problem

Most of the data that companies collect contains personal identifiable information (PII). 
PII was initially restricted to credentials and payment card information but the expanding definition means the problem has only got worse. 
BigID, additionally, has discovered another shortcoming: most companies rarely have complete knowledge of this data’s location. 

Large organizations collect and store huge amounts of data but it’s difficult for them to track, secure or report on this data’s history or flow

Knowing what is customer PII data, along with who has touched it when and how, is increasingly mandated under regulatory requirements. Policy demands and compliances such as GDPR, then, mean that understanding PII is not a good-to-have but essential and crucial to a business’ future. 

Companies need to move from manual and survey-based compliance to data-centric automation and operationalization,

BigID uses machine learning to automate how companies track and secure sensitive data to avoid breaches and non-compliance with data protection regulations.Helps companies meet emerging privacy and data protection regulations like the GDPR.

## How bigid works?


- Scan for identifablility

BigID’s proprietary scanning technology locates sensitive data and provides a score to measure data’s identifiability.

- Data Inventory

 A data inventory is built after the scan that determines the residency of the organization’s identities to make sure that the correct regulations apply. 

- Holistic Map

The scanning process can give a quick snapshot of stored data or help build a more holistic map of stored data. 

- Classification

After the scan, data is classified appropriately to apply the correct security control or decide about compliance, encrypted storage, deletion, archiving, etc. 

- Consent

BigId alsomanages consent of customers and employees, as well as enforces their rights over the personal data and thus allowing organizations to search, identify, segment, and amend personal data as necessary.

## GDPR

### Problem

- Companies need to be able to find all data belonging to European citizens to comply with GDPR.
- Companies should be able to find information on minors, and to be able to find and delete any individual’s information if requested.

Traditional data discovery tools don’t help much when it comes to finding PI/PII residing in BigData. 
They need to stream the data in order to scan it, which isn’t practical given the large amounts of data organizations have now.

They can only find identifiable information, like Social Security number or phone number, but not contextual personal information like date of birth.

They can’t help with data subject rights; they only tell you what type of data is there (classification) but can’t tell you whose data it is for the purpose of reporting back to individuals or to delete their data. 


### Solution

With the use of AI analytics and multiple input channels, data resurfaces, which means you need to continuously validate deletion.


BigID addresses those gaps with the most comprehensive offering, enabling organizations to find and manage all their data, regardless of where it’s stored, what type it is and what format it’s in.

Smart AI-augmented sampling provides accurate results by auditing the petabytes of data leveraging AI to reduce false positives and false negatives, and providing data quality indicators that help manage data quality at scale.
This allows finding all of a user’s transactions, running routes, date of birth, Gender, Religion, Etc.

#### Structured data

Machine Learning-driven discovery and classification of data covers a huge set of big data repositories:
 Hadoop, Hive, HBase, Snowflake, AWS Redshift, AWS EMR, AWS DynamoDB, Cassandra, CouchBase, MongoDB, SAP HANA, ElasticSearch, and Redis

#### Unstructured data
BigID supports unstructured files in Windows shares, Exchange, Gdrive, Box, AWS S3, Azure Storage, NetApp and EMC, among others. 


## Integration

BigID has integrations with Collibra, ASG, SAP, **Salesforce’s SFDC**, Microsoft, Ionic, Immuta, ServiceNow, NetSuite, Workday, Zendesk, Jira, ServiceNow, SurveyMonkey, and others.

Cloud-native architecture allows the deployment of BigID in any Kubernetes environment with automated lateral scaling that supports hybrid deployments for both on premise and in the cloud. 

ML-driven **identity correlation** offers the ability to find all the data for a specific individual across all data sources at extremely high and measurable accuracy.

Compliance features **continuously validate and send alerts** when data of an individual who asked to have it deleted resurfaces and data owners are notified of new data sets when they are discovered.

Breach Notification: if there is a breach, BigID can tell you whose data was impacted.



## Data Lake vs Data warehouse

- A data lake is a vast pool of raw data, the purpose for which is not yet defined. 
- A data warehouse is a repository for structured, filtered data that has already been processed for a specific purpose.
